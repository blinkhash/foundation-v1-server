This portal is an extremely efficient, highly scalable, all-in-one, easy to setup cryptocurrency mining platform written entirely in Node.JS. Its main features include a stratum poolserver and reward/payment/share processor. The website functionality has been removed in lieu of a client that will be developed in a separate repository.

For help with getting started, you can check out the documentation for the platform at https://blinkhash.com/docs. Sample configuration files for individual coins are also located at https://github.com/blinkhash/foundation-configurations.

#### Need Support?

If you need help with a code-related matter, the first place to look is our [Discord](https://discord.gg/8xtHZFKJQY), where the developers will be available to answer any questions. However, please do not come to me with issues regarding setup. Use Google and the existing documentation for that.

Maintaining this project has always been driven out of nothing more than a desire to give back to the mining community, however I always appreciate donations, especially if this repository helps you in any way.
